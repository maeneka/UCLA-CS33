Maeneka Grewal – 204901948CS 33Homework #2Answer: wrongHow to Approach Problem:The magical 8 ball 3-dimensional array begins at memory location 0x7fffffffe000. To get to the [3] part of magic8ball[3][4] you need to do 3*8*8, which is 192. 192 in hex is c0. Add this to the original address to get 0x7fffffffe0c0. Then to access the [4] part of magic8ball[3][4] you need to do 4*8 which is 32, aka 20. Add this to the previous address to get 0x7fffffffe0e0 (c+2 is e). This is the address the word is contained at. Looking at the address, we see the bytes for each letter of the word. The problem tells us that the structure is little endian, meaning the ‘first’ part is stored at the furthest location. We can use the ascii table provided to decode the message.0x7fffffffe0e0: 0x57 0x72 0x6f 0x6e 0x67 0x00 0x00 0x00So first 0x00 is null. This takes care of those last 3. Then 0x67 is g. 0x6e is n. 0x6f is o. 0x72 is r. Lastly, 0x57 is w. The word is ‘wrong’.
